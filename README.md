I've been supporting some new Adios users (our numbers are growing!), and sending links to my config started being less
helpful. There's a lot there that's hard to understand as a new user, and I wanted to have something to link that only
had the "necessary" stuff.

This repo aims to be very overcommented, so you can understand basic principles of adios modules and how to write
wrappers with them. The main bit of code I actually recommend copying from this repo is the `default.nix` (sans
overexplanatory comments). Understanding how to write Adios modules isn't that hard, but the linking stage of getting
access to those modules is more difficult, and will be the same for pretty much everyone.
