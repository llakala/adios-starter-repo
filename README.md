I've been supporting some new Adios users (our numbers are growing!), and sending links to my config started being less
helpful. There's a lot there that's hard to understand as a new user, and I wanted to have something to link that only
had the "necessary" stuff.

I'm normally not a believer in starter configs for nix stuff - but learning the relevant incantations for Adios linking
is pretty difficult, and I felt something really small would be more useful than it is a cognitohazard.
